Getting and Cleaning Data Project Repository
===================

A repository for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This reposotory contains a script which allows the user to reduce the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set down to a wide table of mean measurement values.
Details of the variables and dataset are in the codebook.md file in this repository.

To reduce the data set:
1) Make sure that the raw data folder "UCI HAR Dataset" is in your R working directory
2) Run the script "run_analysis.R"
3) The script will read in the raw data and produce an output file "project_data.txt" containing the reduced dataset
